# Pathfinding Visualizer

Pathfinding Visualizer is a web-based application that allows you to visualize various pathfinding algorithms. The tool helps in understanding how different algorithms navigate through a grid to find the shortest path between two points.

## Features
- Visualize popular pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra's, A*, and more.
- Interactive grid where you can add walls and watch how algorithms handle them.
- Speed controls to watch the algorithms in action at your own pace.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/hugolindberg3/pathfinding-visualizer.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd pathfinding-visualizer
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4. Run the development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

### Usage
1. After running the development server, open your web browser.
2. Navigate to the local server address provided by the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
3. Interact with the visualizer by adding obstacles, and selecting different algorithms to see how they perform.
